# Debugging and Error Handling

Debugging is an essential skill for any software developer. It involves identifying and fixing errors in my code to ensure it runs as expected. Here are some common types of errors and strategies for debugging them.

## Types of Errors
1. **Syntax Errors**: Mistakes in the code's structure (e.g., missing parentheses or incorrect indentation).
2. **Runtime Errors**: Errors that occur during program execution (e.g., division by zero or accessing an out-of-range index).
3. **Logical Errors**: Errors where the code runs but produces incorrect results due to flawed logic.

## Debugging Tips
1. **Read Error Messages**: Carefully read error messages to identify the issue.
2. **Use Print Statements**: Add print statements to trace the flow of your program and identify where things go wrong.
3. **Use a Debugger**: Tools like VS Code's built-in debugger allow you to step through your code and inspect variables.
4. **Search Online**: Copy and paste error messages into Google to find solutions on forums like Stack Overflow.

## Example: Handling Runtime Errors
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
