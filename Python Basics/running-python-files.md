## 3. Running Python Files

Once I’ve written my Python code, I’ll need to run it to see the results. Here’s how to execute a Python file:

### Steps
1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `example.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where your file is saved.
4. Run the file using the `python` command:

### Example
```python
print("Welcome to Python!")
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
