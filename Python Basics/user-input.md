## 2. Getting User Input

The `input()` function allows you to get input from the user. It pauses the program and waits for the user to type something, which can then be stored in a variable.

### Example
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print(f"{name} is {age} years old!")
